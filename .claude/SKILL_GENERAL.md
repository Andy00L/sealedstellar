description: Non-negotiable coding standards, project-agnostic. Use this skill EVERY time you write, edit, refactor, or review code, create a file or folder, add a component, or generate a prompt that will produce code, in any repository. This applies to all languages and frameworks, even for one-line changes. If code is being produced or modified in any form, these standards apply.

# Coding Standards (general)

These rules are the floor, not the ceiling. A change that violates any of them is not finished, regardless of whether it works. Project-specific skills or CLAUDE.md files add to these rules; they never relax them. On any conflict, the stricter rule wins.

Security has its own document, REFERENCE_SECURITY_AUDIT.md. Its always-on rules apply to every change with the same force as this file.

## 1. Before writing anything

- Read every file you are about to modify, in full, in this session. Never guess at file contents.
- Learn the repository's conventions before adding to it: naming style, folder layout, error-handling pattern, package manager, verification command. Match them. Never introduce a second package manager, formatter, or test runner alongside an existing one.
- Reuse-first. Before creating any function, helper, hook, or component, search the codebase for an existing one that does the same or a closely similar thing. Reuse it, or extend it. If nothing matches, state in one line why nothing existing matched before creating something new.
- Never duplicate logic. Two functions doing almost the same thing is a bug in the making: extract the shared part, parameterize the difference.
- Investigate imports before touching any shared signature: list every import site first.
- Never hardcode a value (enum, limit, header name, address) from memory when it exists in a source of truth (schema, types file, config, official docs). Read the source and cite it in a comment.

## 2. Naming: declarative, always

- Never write functions or callbacks as `a(b)`. Every function name is a verb phrase that states what it does. Every variable name states what it holds.

```ts
// BAD
const f = (x) => x.filter((u) => u.a);
items.map((i) => i.n);

// GOOD
const filterActiveAccounts = (accounts: Account[]) =>
  accounts.filter((account) => account.isActive);
orders.map((order) => order.total);
```

- Single-letter identifiers are banned, including in `map`/`filter`/`reduce` callbacks and destructuring.
- Booleans read as questions: `isExpired`, `hasPayment`, `shouldRetry`.
- Constants in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE with a comment stating their unit and source.

## 3. Folder and file hygiene

- One concern per folder. A folder that handles the server side of a feature contains server code only. Never drop a routing or UI file inside a server-implementation folder. Routing files live in the framework's routing tree; business logic lives in `lib/`, `services/`, or `actions/`.

```
BAD:  src/lib/payments/page.tsx          (UI file inside a server lib folder)
GOOD: src/app/.../checkout/page.tsx      (routing file in the routing tree)
      src/lib/payments/...               (server logic only)
```

- Components go in the main components folder at the root (for example `src/components/`), organized by domain subfolder there. Never create a new `components/` folder under a specific route or feature subfolder when a root components folder exists. Every component stays discoverable in one place.

```
BAD:  src/app/dashboard/settings/components/ApiKeysCard.tsx
GOOD: src/components/settings/ApiKeysCard.tsx
```

- The examples above use a Next.js layout. The principle is universal: routing with routing, business logic with business logic, components in one discoverable tree. Apply it with whatever names the framework uses.
- Existing violations of this rule are cleaned opportunistically when you are already touching those files. Do not launch mass-move refactors for their own sake.
- New files get the minimal correct location on the first try. If unsure where something belongs, look at where its closest existing sibling lives, then apply the rules above.

## 4. Frontend: React rules

This section applies when the project uses React (with or without Next.js). Skip it otherwise; the rest of this document still applies.

- `useEffect` is a last resort. Default budget per component: zero. Before reaching for it, use in this order:
  1. Derive the value during render (most "sync state with props" effects are just derived values).
  2. Handle it in the event handler that causes the change.
  3. Use a `key` prop to reset component state.
  4. Move the work to a server component or server action.
- The only legitimate `useEffect` is synchronizing with a system React does not own: IntersectionObserver, browser event listeners, third-party widgets, subscriptions. Each such effect gets a comment naming the external system and a cleanup function.
- Client-side interactivity markers (such as `"use client"`) go only on the leaf components that truly need them. Pages stay server-rendered where the framework allows it.
- No `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` unless the feature explicitly requires persistence and the user asked for it. State lives in component state or on the server.

## 5. Errors and types

- Errors as values. No `throw` in business logic; functions return discriminated results (`{ ok: true, ... } | { ok: false, reason }`) and callers branch on them. The only exceptions are frameworks that drive retries through thrown errors (background-job workers); document each one where it happens.
- Banned outright in TypeScript: `any`, `@ts-ignore`, `as unknown as`, and every other form of type suppression. Fix the type, not the checker. Equivalent suppressions are banned in other languages too.
- Handle the edges in the same commit as the happy path: empty input, null, oversized input, concurrent access, malformed payloads, network failure, partial failure, restart after crash.

## 6. Logging and comments

- Every console or logger line carries a `[FunctionName]` prefix.
- Comments explain intent and the why of non-obvious decisions, not a restatement of the syntax.
- When a literal was extracted from another file (a header name, an enum value, a limit), the comment carries a sourceRef: the file it came from.
- Never log secrets, tokens, or private keys. Redact or truncate identifiers that grant access.

## 7. Dead code

- Clean up dead code on your way through every file you touch: unused imports, unreachable branches, commented-out blocks, parameters nothing reads, exports nothing imports.
- Deleting is part of the change, not a separate favor.

## 8. Writing requirements

- The em dash character (U+2014) is banned in every file: code, comments, strings, markdown, JSON. The en dash (U+2013) is banned as punctuation too. Use a period, comma, colon, or parentheses; use a plain hyphen for ranges. Grep for both before finishing.
- Banned words anywhere in code, comments, docs, or copy: unprecedented, remarkable, flagship, exceptional, cutting-edge, revolutionary, next-generation, paradigm shift, synergy, leverage (as a verb), empower, streamline, seamlessly, holistic, best-in-class, world-class, robust ecosystem, turnkey.
- No empty superlatives. Give the number, the limit, the benchmark.
- These rules cover every artifact a task produces: code, docs, README, UI copy, commit messages, reports, JSON.
- Code, comments, and commit messages in English.

## 9. Workflow

- The agent never runs any git command: no git init, no git add, no git commit, no git push, no merge, rebase, stash, or tag. It never publishes packages either. The human commits, pushes, and publishes manually.
- When requirements are ambiguous or conflict, or when the next step is irreversible (publishing, deploying, database migrations or destructive writes, payments, sending anything), stop and ask the human. Improvising past a doubt is not production grade.
- Verify with the project's established build or test command before declaring anything done. If full-codebase type checking is known to be expensive or broken in the project, type-check only the touched files through a scoped, temporary config, then delete it.
- After every task, produce a full files-affected report: every file created, modified, or deleted, one line each.
- After the report, print a git handoff block for the human to run: `git add` with every touched file listed explicitly (never `git add .` or `git add -A`, never stage `.env` or secrets), a `git commit -m` with a drafted message, then `git push`. One block per logical commit. These commands are text to copy; the agent never executes them.
- Production grade only. No demos, no simplified versions, no "good enough". If the work needs more output, write more output.

## Final check before declaring done

Run these on every file you touched and expect zero hits. The dash pattern uses escapes so this file itself stays clean.

```bash
# long dashes (em dash U+2014, en dash U+2013), matched by UTF-8 bytes for portability
grep -rnP "\xe2\x80\x94|\xe2\x80\x93" <touched files>

# type suppressions
grep -rnE "(:\s*any\b|@ts-ignore|@ts-expect-error|as unknown as|type:\s*ignore)" <touched files>

# browser storage (allowed only if the user explicitly asked for persistence)
grep -rnE "localStorage|sessionStorage" <touched files>

# banned words (review hits by hand; "leverage" is banned as a verb only)
grep -rniE "unprecedented|remarkable|flagship|exceptional|cutting-edge|revolutionary|next-generation|paradigm shift|synergy|leverage|empower|streamline|seamless|holistic|best-in-class|world-class|robust ecosystem|turnkey" <touched files>
```

Then by hand: no single-letter callback parameters, every log line carries a `[FunctionName]` prefix, no secrets in logs. Then the project's build command green. Then the files-affected report and the git handoff block. Only then is the work finished.
